# The First 111 — $TOCA Mint Ritual
**A ledger of presence. A gesture remembered. A currency born from care.**
This repository contains the public-facing mint page for *The First 111* — a foundational ritual offering for **$TOCA**, the first cryptocurrency rooted in touch, trust, and presence.

## About

**$TOCA** is not a typical token. It is a **protocol of peace**.

The First 111 is a ceremonial NFT drop that:

- Launches the **Proof of Touch** (PoT) protocol  
- Seeds the treasury for the **REZ** haptic contract layer  
- Marks the origin of a decentralized economic nervous system

Each minted NFT — called a **GEST** — carries a poetic phrase and timestamp. It is a vow, not a product.

## Philosophy

> “What you touch, you change.”  
>  
> $TOCA is not minted to flip.  
> It is remembered to transform.

This project is about restoring **meaning in digital value.** It’s open to anyone who acts with consent, curiosity, and care.
